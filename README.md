# Transaction-Fraud-Detection-Application
The Transaction Fraud Detection Application built using Python facilitates improvements in financial security by identifying potentially fraudulent activities and flagging them in real time. The application can be used with an easy interface to input transaction-related details such as transaction ID, amount, location, and timestamp as well as the account balance. Based on predefined rules and conditions, the application analyses the data to identify anomalies or patterns indicative of frauds. Transactions are evaluated against three primary criteria: exceeding a set transaction amount threshold, resulting in an account balance below the minimum allowed, and being conducted during unusual hours, such as midnight to 4 AM.

The application aims at reducing the risk of financial fraud through a preliminary detection system that can alert the users or even the system administrators to suspicious activity. Its emphasis is on accuracy with alerts and then legitimate transactions left undisturbed, yet catching high-risk scenarios. The application is modular and adaptable for varied use cases such as personal monitoring accounts, corporate financial systems, or e-commerce platforms. Automation of the fraud detection process, making this system contribute to a more secure and reliable financial environment by providing detailed reasons for flagged transactions.
